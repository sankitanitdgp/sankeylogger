**What is a keylogger?**
A keylogger is an insidious form of spyware. You enter sensitive data onto your keyboard, believing nobody is watching. In fact, keylogging software is hard at work logging everything that you type.

Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit – all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals wait to make use of all this sensitive information.

Reading the keylogger definition, you might think all keyloggers are illegal. 

They aren’t. They do have legitimate, useful applications. For example, keyloggers are often used by IT departments to troubleshoot problems and systems. Also, they can keep an eye on employee activities. And on a personal level, you can keep an eye on what your kids are up to on your computer. Plus there are plenty of other perfectly legal use cases for installing a keylogger on computers. (Well, you can trust me with a white hat!)

Keylogging goes south and becomes a threat if there is malicious intent. Simply put, if you install a keylogger on a device you own, it is legal. If a keylogger is installed behind the back of the actual owner to steal data, it is illegal.
